# arsenal-starting-lineup

Idea is to create Arsenal team lineup visually.

To start the project:
* npm install
* node app.js
* localhost:3000

Js file (for the client side) generated with babel (Convert Ecmascript 6 to 5):
* node babel.js

Future improvements:
  * Store data in database and request for changes (if there is any) in a certain period of time
  * Get position of players somhow and draw them into the starting lineup based on that
  * Use pictures with player names
  * Implement real drag and drop feature
